## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the use of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze tweets for signs of depression. It includes sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library and classification using various algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

## Features

- Upload a JSON file containing tweets for analysis.
- Perform sentiment analysis to determine the polarity of tweets.
- Classify tweets as depressed or not depressed based on sentiment analysis.
- Compare the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms.
- Display model performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Download datasets of depressed and not depressed tweets.
- Visualize counts, percentages, and comparisons of depressed and not depressed tweets.
